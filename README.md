# factor-jpeg
jpeg encoding/decoder native to factor

## The Process Roadmap

### factor-jpeg0: The Naive Implementation

dct : working but needs to be written again

huffman: working -- seems pretty alright

quantizier: working 

marker: very naive, kind of working

### factor-jpeg1: The Standard Implementation


### factor-jpeg2: Faster than Monkey Wu-Kong Edition


### Fields of Factor: Needs More JPEG Appendix

The Final Codex needed in explaining what the hell is going on in a JPEG encoding/decoder.  For some reason everyone has parts of an explanation but not a good full one.
